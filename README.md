# l1

This repository contains scripts for BFS and DFS algorithms.

## Usage

To execute the scripts, follow these steps:

1. #### Clone the Repository:

Clone the AI-l1 repository from my GitHub repositories in VS Code.

2. #### Download Input File:

Download the input file in .txt format on which you want to perform BFS and DFS searches. Place the downloaded file in the same folder where you cloned the repository.

3. #### Configure Script:

- For BFS search:

    Open bfs.py and replace 'example.txt' with 'input.txt' in line number 193.

- For DFS search:

    Open dfs.py and replace 'example.txt' with 'input.txt' in line number 197.

 Note: If you're using a file other than **`'input.txt'`**, rename the file accordingly (e.g., **`'input_one.txt'`**, **`'input_two.txt'`**) and replace **`'example.txt'`** with the new filename as explained above.

 4. #### Run the Code:

 After configuring the script, execute the code.

 ## Output

 Once the code is run, you will obtain the desired output as described. Screenshot of the output for the provided example are attached.
